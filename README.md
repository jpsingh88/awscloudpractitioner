* **Understanding core concepts:** I prioritized a thorough understanding of AWS services and their functionalities over memorizing specific questions and answers.
* **Hands-on practice:** The YouTube series by Abhishek.Veeramalla and practice exams were instrumental in solidifying my understanding through practical exercises.
* **Scenario-based practice:** Practicing scenario-based questions helped me apply my knowledge to real-world situations.
